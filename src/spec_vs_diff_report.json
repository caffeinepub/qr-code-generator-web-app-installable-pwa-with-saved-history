  "summary": "Core QR generation UI (content entry, customization, preview, PNG download) and Internet Identity-based gating for history are present, but key requirements around PWA installability, brand assets, and full saved-history CRUD/persistence are missing or incomplete. The diff also adds unrequested profile/access-control features and expands QR content types beyond the minimum scope.",

      "reason": "The backend only implements save and list; no delete method is shown. Data structures are non-stable in the shown code, so persistence across canister upgrades is not evidenced. Listing order is whatever List.add/toArray yields; no explicit sorting/newest-first is implemented.",
